1).  difference between HTTP1.1 VS HTTP2

		HTTP1.1								
a). It was published in the year 1997 					
b). It supports connection reuse 
c). Introduces a warning header field to carry additional information about the status of a message		
d). It is relatively secure since it uses digest 			
    authentication, NTLM authentication.				
e). Expands on the caching support by using additional 			
    headers
f). HTTP/1.1 provides faster delivery of web pages and			
    reduces web traffic as compared to HTTP/1.0                       	



		HTTP2
(a). It was published in the year 2015
(b)> This uses multiplexing	
(c). Underlying semantics of HTTP such as headers, status codes remains the same.
(d). Security concerns from previous versions will continue to be seen in HTTP/2.
(e). HTTP/2 does not change much in terms of caching
(f). HTTP/2 utilizes multiplexing and server push to effectively reduce the page load time







2). write a blog on objects and it internal representation in javascript

 creating an objects can be done with 2 ways
1.1) object literals
1.2) by creating instance of object

1.1)
object literals
this is an traditional method of creating an objects which contains key value pairs.
object={property1:value1,property2:value2,property3:value3,...propertyN:valueN}
here the property and the value is separated by colon(:)

example=>   let obj={
		firstname:"suhas",
		lastname:"gowda",
		id:24,
		city:"bangalore"
		}
for accessing the object use obj.property
example => obj.firstname =>suhas
	   obj.lastname => gowda
	   obj.id =>24
	   obj.city => bangalore


1.2) creating the instance of object 
this uses new keyword for creating it
example => let obj = new car()
	 obj.color="yellow"
	 obj.company="lamborgini"
	 obj.speed=220
